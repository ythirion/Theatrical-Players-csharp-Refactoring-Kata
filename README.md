# Theatrical Players Refactoring Kata

Original reposiotry from Emily Bache is available [here](https://github.com/emilybache/Theatrical-Players-Refactoring-Kata)

The first chapter of ['Refactoring' by Martin Fowler, 2nd Edition](https://www.thoughtworks.com/books/refactoring2) contains a worked example of this exercise, in javascript. That chapter is available to download for free. This repo contains the starting point for this exercise in several languages, with tests, so you can try it out for yourself.

## What you need to change
Refactoring is usually driven by a need to make changes. In the book, Fowler adds code to print the statement as HTML in addition to the existing plain text version. He also mentions that the theatrical players want to add new kinds of plays to their repertoire, for example history and pastoral.

## Slides to run the kata
We usually run the kata using this [slide deck](https://speakerdeck.com/thirion/theatrical-players-refactoring-kata)
